      {/* Troparia of Thanksgiving Now that the day has come to a close, I thank
      thee, O Lord, and I ask that the evening with the night may be sinless;
      grant this to me, O Saviour, and save me. Glory to the Father, and to the
      Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Now that the day hath passed, I glorify thee,
      O Master, and I ask that the evening, with the night may be without
      offence; grant this to me, O Saviour, and save me. Both now and ever, and
      unto ages of ages. Amen. Now that the day hath run its course, I praise
      thee, O Holy One, and I ask that the evening with the night may be
      undisturbed; grant this to me, O Saviour, and save me. Lord, have mercy.
      (12 times) A Prayer for Forgiveness O Lord our God, if during this day I
      have sinned, whether in word or deed or thought, forgive me all, for thou
      art good and lovest mankind. Grant me peaceful and undisturbed sleep, and
      deliver me from all influence and temptation of the evil one. Raise me up
      again in proper time that I may glorify thee; for thou art blessed: with
      thine Only-begotten Son and thine All-holy Spirit: now and ever, and unto
      ages of ages. Amen. The Creed I believe in one God, the Father Almighty,
      Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in
      one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the
      Father before all worlds, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten,
      not made; of one essence with the Father, by whom all things were made:
      Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, And was
      incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man; And
      was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was
      buried; And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; And
      ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; And He
      shall come again with glory to judge the quick and the dead, Whose kingdom
      shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver
      of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son
      together is worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the Prophets; And I
      believe in One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one
      Baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the Resurrection of the
      dead. And the Life of the world to come. Amen. Prayer of the Hours O
      Christ our God, who at all times and in every hour, in heaven and on
      earth, art worshipped and glorified; who art long-suffering, merciful and
      compassionate; who lovest the just and showest mercy upon the sinner; who
      callest all to salvation through the promise of blessings to come; O Lord,
      in this hour receive our supplications, and direct our lives according to
      thy commandments. Sanctify our souls, hallow our bodies, correct our
      thoughts, cleanse our minds; deliver us from all tribulation, evil and
      distress. Encompass us with thy holy Angels, that guided and guarded by
      them, we may attain to the unity of the faith and to the knowledge of
      thine unapproachable glory, for thou art blessed unto ages of ages. Amen.
      [Here may be added your own private devotions and intercessions, using
      your own words or the "Occasional Prayers". When you have finished,
      conclude with this prayer:] Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, Lord
      Jesus Christ our God, have mercy upon us and save us. Amen. [As you lie
      down to sleep, say:] Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my soul and my
      body. Do thou thyself bless me, have mercy upon me, and grant me life
      eternal. Amen. */}
